# Mocking Dependencies

Consistency is crucial to develop and test UI in isolation.

Ideally, your Storybook stories should always render the same UI no matter whoâ€™s viewing them when, and whether or not the backend is working. The same input to your story should always result in identical output.

- **Decorators**: if your component depends on data from context providers you can mock those out by wrapping stories with decorators

- **MSW-Addon**: for UIs whose inputs are fetched from network you can use Mock Service Worker-Addon

- **Module Mocking**: Since Storybook 8.1 others sources like e.g. browser API, localStorage or cookies can be mocked with module mocking

# Mocking Dependencies - Decorators

Components can receive data or configuration from context providers. For example, a styled component might access its theme from a ThemeProvider or Redux uses React context to provide components access to app data. To mock a provider, you can wrap your component in a [decorator](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/decorators) that includes the necessary context.

```ts {monaco}
import React from 'react';

import { Preview } from '@storybook/react';

import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const preview: Preview = {
  decorators: [
    (Story) => (
      <ThemeProvider theme="default">
        {/* ðŸ‘‡ Decorators in Storybook also accept a function. Replace <Story/> with Story() to enable it  */}
        <Story />
      </ThemeProvider>
    ),
  ],
};

export default preview;
```

# Mocking Dependencies - MSW-Addon

Rather than using real data, we want to be able to control the data. This lets us test different states and generate consistent results.

Therefore we can use the [MSW (Mock-Service-Worker) Storybook Addon](https://github.com/mswjs/msw-storybook-addon?ref=storybookblog.ghost.io)

Usage:

You can pass request handlers into the handlers-property of the msw-parameter:

```ts {monaco}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const SuccessBehavior = {
  parameters: {
    msw: {
      handlers: [
        http.get('/user', () => {
          return HttpResponse.json({
            firstName: 'Neil',
            lastName: 'Maverick',
          })
        }),
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

Data can also be mocked with mswjs/data

# Mocking Dependencies - [Module Mocking](https://storybook.js.org/blog/type-safe-module-mocking/)

What is module mocking?

> Module mocking is a technique in which you substitute a module that is imported directly or indirectly by your component with a consistent, independent alternative
